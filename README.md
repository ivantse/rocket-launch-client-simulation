# Rocket Launche CLient Code Simulation

### Goal
Create an API for a rocket launch application that will give its users information about the history of rocket launches since 1959.

### Requirements
Your API should return the following data about rocket launches for a given rocket __company__ and/or __date range__.  The API will return:

* Average launch cost (excluding nulls)
* Percent of launches where `mission_status` is `Success`
* The most popular month for rocket launches
* Top three `launch_locations`
* Top three __countries__ where `launch_locations` take place

Your API can be written in any language/framework and use any transport protocol supported by a modern web browser. Please include a simple API reference (i.e. a curl example) so a client application developer can use it. API authentication is not required and assume your API is public. The simulation should take less than three hours to complete.

### Connect to the API
TBD

### Communication
We will invite you to a public slack channel to directly communicate with us while you complete the simulation. Feel free to ask any questions.

### What we are looking for:

* Clearly thought out application structure
* Logically chosen variable and function names
* Git [best practices](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
* A `README.md` with clear instructions on how to run the API


### How to submit your solution
* Make a private fork or clone of this repo
* When you're done, invite [@jeffj](https://github.com/jeffj) as a [admin](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization#permission-levels-for-repositories-owned-by-an-organization) to your repo and send __jeff@sourcetable.com__ an email.
